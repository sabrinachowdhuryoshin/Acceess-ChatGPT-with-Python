# Python Automation of ChatGPT

Python Automation of ChatGPT is a Python script that allows you to automate interactions with OpenAI's ChatGPT API. This script is useful for automating the process of generating responses to text prompts, such as answering customer support inquiries or generating personalized responses to messages.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, you will need to have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine
- An OpenAI API key
- The `requests` and `openai` Python packages installed
  
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `config.py` file and add your OpenAI API key.
3. Open the `chat.py` file and update the prompt variable with the text you want to generate a response for.
4. Run the `chat.py` script.
   
## Configuration

The `config.py` file contains a single variable, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which you will need to update with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

To use the script, open the `chat.py` file and update the `prompt` variable with the text you want to generate a response for. Then, run the script using the following command:

`python chat.py`

The script will send a request to the OpenAI API and generate a response based on the `prompt` variable. The response will be printed to the console.
